###### Q: Do Objects copied again in Python or same Objects passes as an Argument to the function?
*In Python, Objects do not copied again. For mutuable data types, we can update the Object right in the calling function and we even need not to return it explicitly if there is no brokage of Alaising.*

```python
def test_fn(arr):
    print(id(arr))  # arr is the same argument object 
    
    arr += [101]    #ðŸ“Œ Alias not broken + Addition of the new ele at same memory add. 
    print(id(arr))  #  object is added at same memory location | No need to return anything


test_arr = [1,2,3,4,5]
print(id(test_arr))    # id of array before passing into the function

test_fn(test_arr)

print(test_arr)  # Even without returning anything, this array is updated

Output:
139928806989408
139928806989408
139928806989408
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 101]
```
```python
def test_fn(arr):
    print(id(arr))  # arr is the same argument object 
    
    arr = arr + [101]    #ðŸ“Œ Alias has broken now
    print(id(arr))      #  after broken of alias, arr needed to return now


test_arr = [1,2,3,4,5]
print(id(test_arr))    # id of array before passing into the function

test_fn(test_arr)

print(test_arr)  # Even without returning anything, this array is updated

Output:
139928716393440
139928716393440
139928807003312
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

###### Q: What is Lazy Evaluation? Explain with an example.
*According to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20535428), Lazy Evaluation is a technique in which the Object is evaluated when it is Called not when it is Created. In Python, for example, `range(100000)` will give one iterator at a time when it is called. It will not create one lakh objects of class int in the memory.* 

*Lazy Evaluation is a great feature in Python and used across different data structures. If you will iterate over a list, it will keep the current index of the iterator until it will not reach the end of the list & throw StopIteration Exception. If you will add more elements to that list before reaching the end of the list, Lazy Evaluation will help us in iterating through those elements as well.*
